# learning
Collection of my learning projects.

# structure
The way projects are organized:
- "main" tree (base)
- "projects" tree
    - tech I'm learning
        - project
            - subproject (optional)

# projects
Techs and Projects are stored in general in the "projects" branch:

```bach
git checkout projects
```
