# goal
This folder's purpose is to be the start of the tree.

Creating a new branch based on this should result in a cleaner way to manage the projects:

1. Clone repo.
2. Create a branch (for new tech).
3. Switch to that branch.
3. Once finishing studying in that _new tech branch_ push changes, merge with "projects" branch (not rebasing onless needed).
